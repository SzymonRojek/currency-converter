## Project description:
Creating this converter was a good opportunity to think about objects. I wanted to store data inside the object and then choose the data on the basis of the currency and calulcate it by the amount given from the user. I have used ES6 and also divided into small functions just to keep an eye on a "single responsibility" depending on their task.
