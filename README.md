## Description:
Creating this converter was a good opportunity to think about objects. I wanted to store data inside of the object and then have the possibilities to choose data depends on the sort of currency, get a price of the currency and calulcate it by the amount given from the user. I've used ES6 and also divided JS for small functions just to keep an eye on a "single responsibility" depending on their task.
