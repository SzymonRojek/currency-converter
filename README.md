## Project description:
Creating this converter was a good opportunity to think about objects. I wanted to store data inside the object and then choose the data on the basis of the currency and calulcate it by the amount given from the user. I've used ES6 and also divided into small functions just to keep an eye on a "single responsibility" depending on their task.
